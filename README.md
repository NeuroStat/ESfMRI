# An overview of effect sizes and meta-analysis techniques for fMRI data

## Introduction

Github repository accompanying the paper on (standardized) effect sizes and methods to pool them for neuroimaging data. This repository contains two parts. First there is the small Monte-Carlo simulation on the effect of number of scans and subjects in fMRI experiments on standardized effect sizes.
Second there is the assessment of the amount of between-study heterogeneity in the fMRI literature. 

## Project Structure

[1_Simulations](https://github.com/NeuroStat/ESfMRI/tree/master/1_Simulations) contains the Monte-Carlo simulations in **R** <br>
[2_Figures](https://github.com/NeuroStat/ESfMRI/tree/master/2_Figures) contains **R** code to regenerate the figures in the paper. <br>
[3_BSVar](https://github.com/NeuroStat/ESfMRI/tree/master/3_BSVar) contains the between-study heterogeneity analysis. <br>
